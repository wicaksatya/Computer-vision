Circle and Cross Marker Detection with OpenCV
This repository implements algorithms for detecting circle and cross markers in images using OpenCV.

Techniques Used
Canny Edge Detection: This algorithm identifies strong edges within the image, useful for finding the boundaries of the markers.
Hough Transform (Circle): This technique identifies circles in the image based on the edge points detected by Canny edge detection.
Template Matching (Cross): A pre-defined template image of the cross marker is used to locate its position within the main image.
Getting Started
Clone this repository:
Bash
git clone https://<your_github_username>/<repository_name>.git
Use code with caution.
Install dependencies:
This project requires OpenCV to be installed. You can follow the installation instructions from the official OpenCV website: https://opencv.org/

Run the script:
The script for marker detection is likely named marker_detection.py or similar. Execute it using:

Bash
python marker_detection.py <image_path>
Use code with caution.
Replace <image_path> with the actual path to your image file containing the markers.

Expected Output
The script will display the original image with detected circles and bounding boxes around identified cross markers.

Additional Notes
This is a basic implementation and might require adjustments depending on the complexity of your markers and image conditions.
You can modify the script to include functionalities like filtering detected circles based on size or refining cross marker template matching for better accuracy.
Further Exploration

Explore different parameters for Canny edge detection and Hough transform to optimize circle detection for your specific use case.
Consider using machine learning techniques for more robust cross marker detection, especially if the marker design has variations.
